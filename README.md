# 🍩 Rotating 3D Donut in Java

Welcome to the **Rotating Donut** project!  
This project demonstrates a realistic, animated 3D spinning donut (torus) rendered using Java's Swing and AWT libraries.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Real-Time 3D Animation:**  
  The donut rotates smoothly in 3D space with dynamic shading and lighting effects.

- **Custom Lighting:**  
  Adjustable light source for realistic shading and a textured look.

- **Parametric Torus Rendering:**  
  Uses mathematical equations to generate and animate the donut shape.

- **Modern Java GUI:**  
  Built with `JFrame` and `JPanel` for easy execution on any desktop.

## 📂 Files

- [`Donut.java`](Donut.java)  
  Main Java source file containing all rendering and animation logic.

- [`README.md`](README.md)  
  Project documentation (this file).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone or Download** this folder.
2. Open `Donut.java` in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the file:
    ```sh
    javac Donut.java
    java Donut
    ```
4. Enjoy the mesmerizing spinning donut in a window!

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

- The donut is generated using parametric equations for a torus.
- 3D rotation matrices are applied to animate the donut in real time.
- Lighting calculations create a shading effect for a more realistic appearance.
- The animation is continuously updated using a repaint loop.
